## CSV --> API | Django

This is a simple Django implementation which can be used to load data from a CSV and expose the data as an API using the Django Rest Framework, to customise the app, simply modify the requisite .py components to fit the fields of your CSV, then run the custom command
```sh
python manage.py load_csv
```
to load the data from your .csv file into the SQL database.
